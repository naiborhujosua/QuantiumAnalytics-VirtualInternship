## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was interested in supermarket sectors as part of supply chain to help marketers to decide which promotions should be targeting in order to increase the total salesand number of customers.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

# Setup and Context

- You are part of Quantium’s retail analytics team and have been approached by your client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

## Task
- Data analysis and customer segments – 
 - in your analysis make sure you define the metrics
 – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. 
 - Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find. These will all form part of our report to Julia.
 
##  Business Metric
- Total sales revenue
- Total number of customers
- Average number of transactions per customer

## Deep dive into customer segments 
-  Define your recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available on my medium [here](https://medium.com/@naiborhujosua/predicting-airfare-price-using-machine-learning-techniques-bf3a13ad07d1).
